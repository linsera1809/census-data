 * Description: Create a Java class with a main method called CensusData. This class will read data from the URL above.
 * It will use each row of the Census data file to instantiate a Surname object. That Surname object will
 * then be added to a HashMap collection using the surname string as a key.
 *
 * Finally, after the HashMap is fully populated, it will be serialized into a local file named “./surname.dat”.
